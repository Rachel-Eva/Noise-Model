# Quantum Simulation Project

This repository contains a quantum simulation project that implements quantum addition using the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). The main goal of this project is to explore the effects of noise on quantum circuits while performing addition operations. The quantum sum is computed for two integers, and the simulation captures how various noise models impact the accuracy of the results.

## Overview

The core component of this project is a quantum circuit that utilizes QFT to perform the addition of two integers. The implementation incorporates a noise model to simulate real-world quantum hardware conditions, allowing for an analysis of how noise affects the output of the quantum addition operation. The project includes functions for constructing the quantum circuit, applying noise, and analyzing the results.
