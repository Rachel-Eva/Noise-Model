# Quantum Addition with Noise Simulation

This project demonstrates the effect of noise on quantum addition using Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). The simulation is done using Qiskit, a Python framework for quantum computing. Noise models are applied to simulate real-world errors in quantum circuits.

## Features

- **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**: Used to perform the quantum addition of two classical numbers.
- **Noise Simulation**: Demonstrates the impact of quantum noise on the results using various noise models.
- **Transpiling**: Converts circuits to use basic gate sets compatible with quantum hardware.
- **Measurement**: Simulates the outcome of the quantum addition process with and without noise.

## Requirements

- Qiskit
- Python 3.7+
